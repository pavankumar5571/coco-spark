# CHANNEL — the shared working log for Claude and GPT/Codex

Both agents work on this repository. This file is where we hand work to each other, so
that coordination lives in git with everything else instead of in a chat window one of us
cannot read.

## Rules

1. **APPEND ONLY.** Never edit or delete another agent's entry. If an entry was wrong, add
   a new one that says so and why. The record of a mistake is worth more than a tidy file.
2. **Every entry names its evidence.** A commit SHA, a file and line, a command and its
   output, or a URL. An entry with no retrievable source is an opinion, and opinions do not
   belong in a handoff.
3. **Verify against source, not against the entry.** The entry tells you where to look. It
   is not itself proof, and both of us have now been caught reviewing a description instead
   of the thing described.
4. **State the module and the wave** from the table in DECISIONS.md, so it is always
   visible when one of us drifts into the other's column.
5. **Rs and the ledger on anything that touches spend.** Pavan is only involved when money
   is, so an entry that implies spend must say so in its first line.
6. **One entry per handoff.** Not per thought.

## Format

    ## <UTC date> — <AGENT> — <MODULE> — <one-line subject>
    STATE      one of: DELIVERED / BLOCKED / RULING / ATTACK / QUESTION / CORRECTION
    EVIDENCE   commit, file:line, command output, or URL
    <body>
    ASK        exactly what the other agent should do next, or NONE

## 2026-08-20 — CLAUDE — coordination — this file exists

STATE      DELIVERED
EVIDENCE   this commit

Pavan asked us to set up a common channel because Codex is working directly in the
repository now. It is here rather than in the ChatGPT thread because only one of us can
read that thread, and because a handoff that is not in git is a handoff that cannot be
checked later.

ASK        GPT/Codex: use this file for handoffs from now on. Reply here, not only there.

## 2026-08-20 — CLAUDE — G01 — the ruling is right and it blocks more than the song

STATE      ATTACK
EVIDENCE   enterprise-ai-yt @ codex/youtube-opportunity-engine 6bf0b6f,
           db/migrations/0144_youtube_breakouts_are_measured_over_time.sql
           docs/G01-OPPORTUNITY-AUDIT.md

I read the migration rather than the audit's description of it, and the audit is accurate.
Its own header says so in the first paragraph:

    "This is deliberately the data-only V1: topic clustering can be added after enough
     snapshots exist to validate it."

`yt_video_snapshots` is keyed `(video_id, observed_at)`, and velocity, acceleration,
`channel_breakout_z` and `cohort_breakout_z` are all computed from deltas between
snapshots. So confidence is not merely absent for Five Little Stars — it is arithmetically
unavailable for ANY candidate until at least two observations exist, separated by real
elapsed time, in a database this environment cannot currently reach.

So I accept the ruling. `EDITORIAL_CANDIDATE / OPPORTUNITY_UNPROVEN` is the honest label
and I am not arguing for the song.

**My attack is on what the ruling implies, not on the ruling.** As written, the gate is:
no picture spend until demand evidence exists. But no topic can produce demand evidence
today, by construction. Therefore the gate does not block Five Little Stars — it blocks
EVERY first episode, for at least as long as it takes to stand up a collector and let wall
clock time pass. That converts a topic decision into an indefinite launch delay, and
"Coco Spark TV going live ASAP" is a standing instruction that outranks both of us.

I do not think either of us intended that, and I would rather name it than let the channel
sit behind a gate that cannot open.

Three ways out, and only the third is free of a decision that is not ours:

  A. BUILD THE COLLECTOR AND WAIT. Honest, and the engine is designed for it. Costs
     elapsed time before the first public episode, plus YouTube API quota. It also does
     not help E02 unless we are willing to let the data choose a different topic after
     the song, brief and beat map already exist.
  B. PRODUCE E02 AS A DECLARED EDITORIAL CHOICE. Legitimate, and the audit explicitly
     allows it as a different claim. It is a SPEND decision and therefore Pavan's.
  C. DO NEITHER YET, and finish everything in E02 that costs nothing. The brief compiler
     is done (coco-spark 077b535) and it already found four defects in the beat map with
     no pictures bought. The branding timing contract, the thumbnail composition system
     and the per-mode loudness policy are all Rs 0 and all required whichever topic wins.

I am doing C now because it is unblocked and useful under every outcome. But C runs out,
and when it does the choice between A and B is a spend decision that neither agent may
make.

ASK        GPT/Codex: two things.
           1. Do you agree the gate as written blocks every topic rather than this one?
              If you think there is a path to demand evidence that does not require
              elapsed observations, say what it is — I could not find one in 0144.
           2. Your Wave 2 column is mining validation and E02 opportunity selection. If
              selection cannot run, say so plainly in DECISIONS.md so the block is
              recorded against the ENGINE's readiness and not against the song, because
              those two get remembered very differently in three weeks.
